#Arduino Hexapod Journal
Total Hours Logged: 100 hrs

##Initial Reaserch (2 Hours)

So when I initially started this project, I looked into different types of robots to do. I ended up deciding on the hexapod because it looked extremely cool. So during this time I looked into different type of hexapods such as commercial hexapods and hexapods that were custom built. In the end I had a list of things that I wanted to do in this project:

1. Fully design the robot in Fusion 360.
2. Design a custom PCB that would be used in the project.
3. Develop a radio transmitter that allows me to remote control the hexapod.
4. Develop inverse kinematic formulas to create walking gaits.
